-- As noted in the comments below, the up/down buttons don't actually DO anything,
-- apart from the display - in a real program you would have to actually implement
-- whatever it is you want the up/down to do yourself, in the SPIN_CB callback.
-- (An IupText with the SPIN attribute set may be what you're really looking for,
--  at the bottom of demo/pGUI/boids3d.exw you'll find several examples of that.)
